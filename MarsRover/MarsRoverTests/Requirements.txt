1) You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
2) The rover receives a character array of commands.
3) Implement commands that move the rover forward/backward (f,b).
4) Implement commands that turn the rover left/right (l,r).
5) Implement wrapping at edges. Connect the x edge to the other x edge, so (0,0) for x-1 to (5,0), but connect vertical edges towards themselves in inverted coordinates, so (0,0) for y-1 connects to (0,5).
6) Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point, aborts the sequence and reports the obstacle.
